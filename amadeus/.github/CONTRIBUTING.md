cd amadeus-java
gradle
```

Make sure you have Gradle installed as well.

### About Lombok

This library uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) for simplifying the code base. To use this in your editor, make sure to follow the instructions on their site.

For example, for InteliJ follow [these instructions](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij).

### Running tests

To run tests, simply run `./gradlew test`

We are trying to keep 100% coverage, so keep an eye on the `coverage` folder for an overview of the coverage.

### Building

To build the jar run `./gradlew clean build`

### Using a library locally

To use a library locally as a dependency, simply link to this library in your Gradle project by path:

```js
compile files('/path/to/libs/amadeus-java-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar')
```

### Releasing

To make a new release, follow the following steps:

- [ ] Update the version in `Amadeus.java` using semver rules
- [ ] Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version
- [ ] Push all changes and ensure all tests pass on Travis
- [ ] Tag your release in git using `git --tag vX.X.X`
- [ ] Push the new tag `git push --tags`
- [ ] Update the [Releases](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/amadeus-java/releases) tab on GitHub with a new release for the tag, copying the description from the `CHANGELOG.md`

Travis will bow build the library and release it to BinTray and then to Maven Central.
